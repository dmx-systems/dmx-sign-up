# DeepaMehta 4 Sign-up

This plugin introduces a configurable user registration process for DeepaMehta 4 _User Accounts_.

Most (if not all) user facing message are translatable by now. A german language version of this bundle can be build from source after setting the language option to `de` using the `plugin.properties` file.

This plugin adds:
*   A `Sign-up`-link next to the `Login`-button in the DeepaMehta 4 Webclient
*   A `Sign-up Configuration` topic associated to the `DeepaMehta 4 Sign up` Plugin
     (part of the "System" workspace and thus editable by all members of it)

The special features of the **registration ui** is comprised of:
*   Username existence check
*   Email existence check
*   Simple GUI-Notification mechanism
*   Minimal CSS Definition

The special features of the **login ui** is comprised of:
*   Simple GUI-Notification mechanism
*   Automatic redirect
*   Minimal CSS Definition

The **special logic** of this plugin is comprised of:
*   Optionally: Configure a sign-up process with an Email based confirmation workflow<br/>
    Sends confirmation mail with token to the users registering Email address<br/>
    Allows for the password reset functionality to take place also via an Email based confirmation workflow
*   Optionally: Send notifications to system administrator after a new user account was sucessfully created
*   Optionally: If `new_accounts_are_enabled=true`, an account activation notice is sent
*   Optionally: If the email based confirmation workflow is used a "Passwort reset" workflow is available

**Note:** If `Email Confirmation Required` is set to _true_ the confirmation tokens the system sends out are **not persisted** and get lost after a bundle/system restart. Once a token was send out the link containing it is valid for sixty minutes.

## Requirements

DeepaMehta 4 is a platform for collaboration and knowledge management.
https://github.com/jri/deepamehta

To be able to install this module you first and additionally have to install the following DeepaMehta 4 Plugins.

*    `dm48-thymeleaf-0.6.1`-Bundle - Build from [sources](https://github.com/jri/dm4-thymeleaf)

**Operations:** For the plugins mailbox validation process to run you must install this plugin with deepamehta4 on a web server with a 
`postfix` -> `Internet Site` like mail send functionality.

## Download & Installation

You can find the latest stable version of this plugin bundled for download at [http://download.deepamehta.de/nightly/](http://download.deepamehta.de/nightly/).

As mentioned above, you currently need to download and install the aditonally required `dm48-thymeleaf-0.6
.1`-Bundle, too.

After downloading the two bundle-files, place them in the `bundles` folder of your DeepaMehta installation and restart 
DeepaMehta 4.

## Plugin Configuration

The central topic for configuring the sign-up dialog for your DeepaMehta 4 installation is of type `Sign-up 
Configuration`. Editing this topic via your dm4-webclient allows you to interactively control/adapt many options.

Setting a configuration option to an empty value usually means deactivating the features depending on it.

The currently active sign-up configuration is associated with the "Plugin" topic representing this plugin ("DeepaMehta 4 Sign up"). It can be altered by members of the `Administration` workspace.

### Setup Custom Workspace Assignment

There is currently just one special configuration option. To setup a workspace which self-registering users should automatically join (become members of) you need to associate that very workspace topic with your active sign-up configuration. Here comes the pitfall: To take this "custom workspace assignment" into effect you must either restart the platform or press "Edit" on your sign-up configuration topic once. In both cases the configuration is reloaded and therewith comes into immediate effect (see [#1](https://github.com/mukil/dm4-sign-up/issues/1)).
