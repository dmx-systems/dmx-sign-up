# DMX Sign-up

This plugin introduces a configurable user registration process for DMX _User Accounts_.

Most (if not all) user facing message are translatable by now. A german language version of this bundle can be build from source after setting the language option to `de` using the `plugin.properties` file.

This plugin adds:
*   A "User Mailbox" association type to associate "Email Address" w. "User Accounts".
*   A `Sign-up`-link next to the `Login`-button in the DMX Webclient
*   A `Sign-up Configuration` topic associated to the `DMX Sign up` Plugin topic
     (part of the "System" workspace and thus editable by all members of it)
*   A `Forgot password?` link to the `Login`-dialog in the DMX Webclient

The special features of the **self-registration ui** is comprised of:
*   Username existence check
*   Email existence check
*   Simple GUI-Notification mechanism
*   Minimal CSS Definition
*   Administration workspace members can create accounts without email confirmation

The special features of the **login ui** is comprised of:
*   Simple GUI-Notification mechanism
*   Automatic redirect
*   Minimal CSS Definition

The **special logic** of this plugin is comprised of:
*   Optionally: Setup an email based confirmation workflow for new accounts<br/>
    Sends confirmation mail with token to the users registering Email address<br/>
    Allows for the password reset functionality to take place also via an Email based confirmation workflow
*   Optionally: Send notifications to system administrator if a new user account was created
*   Optionally: If `dmx.security.new_accounts_are_enabled` (platform configuration option) is set to `true` an account activation notice is sent
*   Optionally: If a `User Mailbox` exists a "Passwort reset"-workflow is available

**Note:** If `Email Confirmation Required` is set to _true_ the confirmation tokens the system sends out are **not persisted** and get lost after a bundle/system restart. Once a token was send out the link containing it is valid for sixty minutes.

Email address topics of new user accounts are all placed in the "Administration" workspace too.

## Requirements

DMX 5.1: DMX is a platform for collaboration and knowledge management.
https://github.com/dmx-systems/dmx-platform

To be able to install this module you first and additionally have to install the following DMX Plugins.

*    `dmx-thymeleaf-0.9.1+`-Bundle - Build from [sources](https://git.dmx.systems/dmx-plugins/dmx-thymeleaf)
*    `dmx-sendmail-2.0.0+`-Bundle - Build from [sources](https://git.dmx.systems/dmx-plugins/dmx-sendmail)

**Operations:** For the plugins mailbox validation process to run you must install these plugins with DMX on a web server with a 
`postfix` -> `Internet Site` like mail send functionality.

## Download & Installation

You can find the latest stable version of this plugin bundled for download at [https://download.dmx.systems/plugins/](https://download.dmx.systems/plugins/).

As mentioned above, you currently need to download and install the aditonally required `dmx-thymeleaf-0.9.1+`-Bundle, too.

After downloading the two bundle-files, place them in the `bundle-deploy` folder of your DMX installation and restart DMX.

## Plugin Configuration

Since the 2.0.0 release, the following options must be configured in either the dmx-platform's `config.properties` (binary release) or `pom.xml` (if you run the platform from sources) file.

```
dmx.signup.confirm_email_address = true
dmx.signup.admin_mailbox = signup-test@dmx.systems
dmx.signup.system_mailbox = nomail@dmx.systems
dmx.signup.self_registration = false
```

Legacy wise, the rest of the plugin options are stored in DB. The central topic for configuring the sign-up plugin is of type `Sign-up Configuration`. Editing this topic via the DMX Webclient allows you to interactively configure the appearance of the custom login and self-registration dialogs.

The sign-up configuration is associated with the "Plugin" topic representing this plugin ("DMX Sign up"). It can be revealed by all members of the `Administration` workspace.

Note: If you want to use the "Password reset" functionality without allowing users to self-register you must make sure "User Account" topics are equipped with a "User Mailbox". To set this up, see instructions here: https://git.dmx.systems/dmx-plugins/dmx-sign-up/-/issues/2

### Setup Custom Workspace Assignment

There is currently just one more special configuration option: You can setup an automatic workspace assignment for self-registering users. If you do so, new users using the sign-up dialog automatically join (become members of) that works. To do so you need to associate that very workspace topic with your active sign-up configuration. 

And here comes the **pitfall**: To take this "custom workspace assignment" into effect you must press "Edit" and "Save" on your current sign-up configuration topic once (or restart the platform). Only in these two cases the sign-up configuration is reloaded and comes into effect, see [#1](https://github.com/mukil/dm4-sign-up/issues/1)).

You'll notice something similar to the following two lines in your server-side log (when editing and Saving your sign-up configuration):
```
Jan 15, 2021 01:28:37 AM systems.dmx.signup.SignupPlugin reloadAssociatedSignupConfiguration
INFORMATION: Configured Custom Sign-up Workspace => "DMX"
Jan 15, 2021 01:28:37 AM systems.dmx.signup.SignupPlugin reloadAssociatedSignupConfiguration
INFORMATION: Sign-up Configuration Loaded (URI="dmx.signup.default_configuration"), Name="My DMX"
```
