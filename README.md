# DeepaMehta 4 Sign-up

This plugin introduces a configurable registration process for DeepaMehta 4 _User Accounts_.

This plugin adds:
*    A `Sign-up`-link next to the `Login`-button in the DeepaMehta 4 Webclient
*    A `Sign-up Configuration` topic associated to the `DeepaMehta 4 Sign up` Plugin
     (part of the "System" workspace and thus editable by `admin`)

The special features of the `registration` dialog is comprised of:
*    Username existence check
*    Email existence check
*    Simple GUI-Notification mechanism
*    Minimal CSS Definition

The special features of the `login` dialog is comprised of:
*    Simple GUI-Notification mechanism
*    Automatic redirect
*    Minimal CSS Definition

The special logic of this plugin is comprised of:
*    Optionally: Configure a sign-up process with an Email based confirmation workflow
*    Optionally: Sends confirmation mail with token to the users registering Email address
*    Optionally: Sends notification to admin after a new user account was sucessfully created
*    Optionally: If `new_accounts_are_enabled=true`, an account activation notice is sent

Note: If `Email Confirmation Required` is set to _true_ the confirmation tokens the system sends out are **not persisted** and get lost after a bundle/system restart. Once a token was send out the link containing it is valid for sixty minutes.

## Requirements

DeepaMehta 4 is a platform for collaboration and knowledge management.

To be able to install this module you first and additionally have to install the following DeepaMehta 4 Plugins.

*    `dm47-webactivator-0.4.6`-Bundle - Build from [sources](https://github.com/jri/dm4-webactivator)

For the plugins mailbox validation process to run you must install this plugin with deepamehta4 on a web server with a 
`postfix` -> `Internet Site` like mail send functionality.

## Download & Installation

You can find the latest stable version of this plugin bundled for download at [http://download.deepamehta.de/nightly/](http://download.deepamehta.de/nightly/).

As mentioned above, you currently need to download and install the aditonally required `dm47-webactivator-0.4
.6`-Bundle, too.

parameters:

### TODOs

- Assign newly registered user account to a specific workspace by default (and configuration)
- Switch plugin configuration to the new dm4-config facility
