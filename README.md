# DeepaMehta 4 Sign-up

This plugin introduces a configurable user registration process for DeepaMehta 4 _User Accounts_.

Most (if not all) user facing message are translatable by now. A german language version of this bundle can be build from source after setting the language option to `de` using the `plugin.properties` file.

This plugin adds:
*   A `Sign-up`-link next to the `Login`-button in the DeepaMehta 4 Webclient
*   A `Sign-up Configuration` topic associated to the `DeepaMehta 4 Sign up` Plugin
     (part of the "System" workspace and thus editable by all members of it)

The special features of the **registration dialog** is comprised of:
*   Username existence check
*   Email existence check
*   Simple GUI-Notification mechanism
*   Minimal CSS Definition

The special features of the **login dialog** is comprised of:
*   Simple GUI-Notification mechanism
*   Automatic redirect
*   Minimal CSS Definition

The **special logic** of this plugin is comprised of:
*   Optionally: Configure a sign-up process with an Email based confirmation workflow<br/>
    Sends confirmation mail with token to the users registering Email address<br/>
    Allows for the password reset functionality to take place also via an Email based confirmation workflow
*   Optionally: Sends notification to admin after a new user account was sucessfully created
*   Optionally: If `new_accounts_are_enabled=true`, an account activation notice is sent

**Note:** If `Email Confirmation Required` is set to _true_ the confirmation tokens the system sends out are **not persisted** and get lost after a bundle/system restart. Once a token was send out the link containing it is valid for sixty minutes.

## Requirements

DeepaMehta 4 is a platform for collaboration and knowledge management.
https://github.com/jri/deepamehta

To be able to install this module you first and additionally have to install the following DeepaMehta 4 Plugins.

*    `dm48-thymeleaf-0.6.1`-Bundle - Build from [sources](https://github.com/jri/dm4-thymeleaf)

**Operations:** For the plugins mailbox validation process to run you must install this plugin with deepamehta4 on a web server with a 
`postfix` -> `Internet Site` like mail send functionality.

## Download & Installation

You can find the latest stable version of this plugin bundled for download at [http://download.deepamehta.de/nightly/](http://download.deepamehta.de/nightly/).

As mentioned above, you currently need to download and install the aditonally required `dm48-thymeleaf-0.6
.1`-Bundle, too.

After downloading the two bundle-files, place them in the `bundles` folder of your DeepaMehta installation and restart 
DeepaMehta 4.

## Plugin Configuration

The central topic for configuring the sign-up dialog for your DeepaMehta 4 installation is of type `Sign-up 
Configuration`. Editing this topic via your dm4-webclient allows you to interactively control/adapt the following 
parameters:

*    all text-messages, hyperlinks, titles, logo, css, read more url of the login and sign-up pages
*    the terms of service and privacy policy (including checkbox labels) used in the sign-up form
*    the page footer (HTML) of all pages
*    the path to a custom image file as logo
*    the path to a custom CSS file replacing the default style
*    the mailbox emails are sent from
*    the administrators mailbox where the system sends notifications to
*    the flag `Email Confirmation Required` is there to decide whether to involve Emails at all
*    the workspace a user becomes automatically member of when signing up is now configurable<br/>
     this is simply reflected in _Association_ between the sign-up configuration topic and the workspace, meaning if there is such an assocation members will automatically get a membership to this workspace (if it is not _Confidential_ or _Private_)
*    furthermore, an additional custom workspace setting is available<br/>
     (_API Enabled_, _API Description_, _API Details_, _API Workspace URI_), this allows to configure a second, opt-in style, workspace membership for which user can make a membership request on the new `/sign-up/edit` page
*    the home page url (redirecting after log-out) and the start page url (redirecting after login) are new options and come with respective configurable messages/labels which are displayed by the UI when redirecting
*    and some more options by now...

A configuration topic is associated with the "Plugin" topic representing this plugin upon installation and can be altered by user `admin`. Setting input fields to an empty value means deactivating the features who depend on this configuration value it.
